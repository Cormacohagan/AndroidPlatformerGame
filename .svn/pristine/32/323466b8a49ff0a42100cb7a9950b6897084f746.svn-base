Collision detection:
- Player now slides off of the moving platform when they should be stationary (in relation to the platform)
- If player stand still on moving platform, and waits for it to move away from under their feet,
    the game still treats the player as if they're on solid ground, and they can now walk on the air
- If player jumps and:  is touching a tile to his left or right
                        has no vertical momentum (such as at the arc of his jump)..
    ..the player can jump again (like a buggy walljump)
- If the moving platform comes down on top of the player's head, it forces them down through the tile they're standing on

Main menu:
- Push button images are stretched vertically & only the bottom half of the button can be clicked (due to the stretching)

Game world:
- When the player loses all of their HP due to a hazard, they die repeatedly and lose all of their lives
- No way to restart game after a death

Player:
- Animations are buggy: If the player jumps and turns left or right, they'll start their grounded running animation
